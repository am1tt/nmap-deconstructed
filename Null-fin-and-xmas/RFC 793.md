## 🗒️RFC 793 
----
> `RFC 793` mandates that

* Network hosts to malformed packets with a `RST TCP packet` for closed ports

* and dont respond at all for open ports (referring to open and open | filtered )

> however in MS Windows , and alot of CISCO network dev , are known to respond in *RST* to any malformed TCP packets , regardless if they are open or closed

* this results in all ports showing up as being **CLOSED***





## 🔥Firewall evasion
---
* many firewalls are *configured* to drop TCP packets to blocked ports , which contains a **SYN Flag set** (blocking new initiation reqeusts)

* by sending requests that do not contain `SYN Flag` , we can effectively *bypass* this kind of **firewall**

* most modern **IDS**(Intrusion detection system) are savvy to scan types , so don't rely on them to be 100% effective when dealing with modern systems
